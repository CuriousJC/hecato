# hecato

hecato - Short for [Hecatoncheires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecatoncheires), the Hundred-Handed giants of Greek mythology - is a file system CLI that can be used to investigate various information about the system. Hecato is one of my first Go programs but is my attempt to use Go to solve a number of investigatory things I've found myself needing to do in the past. Eventually I hope to make the "hundred hands" reference meaningful by learning concurrent programming.

## Examples

```bash
hecato -examples
```
